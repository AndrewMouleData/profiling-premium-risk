/*
01_create_mart_vehicle_level_severity.sql

Vehicle-level severity aggregation layer for the profiling_premium_risk mart schema.

Purpose:
- Aggregate casualties (severity & count) to the vehicle involvement grain: 
  1 row per (collision_index, vehicle_reference) for vehicles with linked 
  casualty rows.
- Produce casualty severity counts per vehicle alongside a derived 
  weighted severity score.
- Create a table that can be safely joined onto stg.vehicles_2015_2024 
  in later mart steps.

Design choices:
- Vehicles with associated casualties only: this table includes only 
  vehicles with linked casualty rows; vehicles with no casualties will 
  be brought back later via LEFT JOIN from stg.vehicles with COALESCE to zero.
- Vehicle-first aggregation: severity is aggregated at the vehicle 
  involvement level before any vehicular profile grouping to preserve 
  granularity at this moment.
- Heuristic weighting: severity is represented using three fixed 
  constants aligned to the ordinal injury categories in STATS19. This enables 
  construction of an interpretable weighted injury-burden measure for downstream 
  vehicle-profile contribution analysis.
