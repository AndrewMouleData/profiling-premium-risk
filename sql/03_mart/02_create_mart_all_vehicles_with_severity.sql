/*
02_create_mart_all_vehicles_with_severity.sql

Vehicle-level join layer for the profiling_premium_risk mart schema.

Purpose:
- Attach vehicle-level severity outcomes onto the full set of 
  collision-involved vehicles.
- Ensure vehicles with no linked casualty rows are retained for 
  downstream frequency calculations.

Design choices:
- LEFT JOIN: keeps all vehicles from stg.vehicles_2015_2024, even when 
  no severity row exists.
- COALESCE to zero: treats missing severity as zero injuries, so later 
  aggregation can sum cleanly without NULL handling.
- No banding and no aggregation: this script is only about building 
  a clean vehicle-level base table for later steps.
