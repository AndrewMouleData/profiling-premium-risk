/*
03_create_mart_vehicle_dimensions.sql

Dimension prep layer for the profiling_premium_risk mart schema.

Purpose:
- Enrich mart.all_vehicles_with_severity_2015_2024 with analysis-ready dimensions.
- Decode coded categorical fields (vehicle_type, propulsion_code) into 
  human-readable labels.
- Convert continuous numeric variables (engine_capacity_cc, age_of_vehicle) into 
  stable bands for downstream GROUP BY.

Design choices:
- Separation of semantics & structure:
  1. Categorical decoding for readable meaning is performed in the CTE.
  2. Banding of continuous variables explicitly shapes future grouping structure 
     and is applied in the outer SELECT.
- Categorical preservation: original coded fields are retained alongside decoded 
  labels and derived bands at this stage to preserve traceability and allow 
  future refinement before final aggregation.
- Engine capacity banding handling: bands are designed in accordance with dataset 
  distribution. Certain propulsion types (electric, fuel-cell, etc.) are handled 
  with N/A, while NULL and negative coded values are treated as Unknown.
- Explicit unknown handling: NULL values and undefined codes (e.g., -1) are grouped 
  into labelled categories so they remain visible and auditable in downstream analysis.
