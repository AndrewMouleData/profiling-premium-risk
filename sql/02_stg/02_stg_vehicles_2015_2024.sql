/*
02_stg_vehicles_2015_2024.sql

Staging layer for vehicle-level records within the profiling_premium_risk database.

Purpose:
- Time-scope data (2015-2024) via semi-join with stg.collisions.
- Standardise 'raw' TEXT type strings into deliberate typed formats.
- Maintain lineage by preserving original categorical codes and sentinel values (e.g., -1).
- Remove ONLY redundant identifiers where:
  1. A more authoritative alternative exists
  2. Fields that have been replaced by a current equivalent.

Design choices:
- Filter logic: Vehicles are scoped by collision_index as the source lacks native date fields.
- Type casting: Strings are trimmed and 'NA' literals converted to NULL prior to
  casting to prevent execution failure.
- Business logic: None. Modelling and semantic recoding are deferred to downstream layers.
- Fractional values: Engine/severity fields cast to NUMERIC where precision is required.

Fields dropped (redundant/obsolete):
- collision_ref_no, vehicle_manoeuvre_historic, vehicle_location_restricted_lane_historic,
  journey_purpose_of_driver_historic
